### Completion Instructions

<details>
<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>
<br/>

The app must have the following functionalities

- When invalid credentials are provided in the login form and **Login** button is clicked, then the respective error message from the response should be displayed
- When the **username** and **password** are provided correctly and **Login** button is clicked, then the page should navigate to Home Route
- When an unauthenticated user tries to access the Home Route, Products Route or Cart Route, then the page should be redirected to the Login Route
- When an authenticated user tries to access the Home Route, Products Route or Cart Route, then the page should be navigated to the respective route
- When an authenticated user tries to access the Login Route, then the page should be redirected to the Home Route
- When the Logout button is clicked, then the page should be navigated to the Login Route
- When an unauthenticated user tries to access the Home Route, Products Route or Cart Route, then the page should be navigated to the Login Route using the protected route
- When an authenticated user tries to access the Home Route, Products Route or Cart Route, then the page should be navigated to the respective route using the protected route

<br/>
- When an authenticated user opens the Products Route,

  - An HTTP GET request should be made to **productsApiUrl** with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and query parameters `title_search`, `category`, and `rating` with initial values as **empty strings**
    - **_loader_** should be displayed while fetching the data
    - After the data is fetched successfully, display the products list received in the response
    - If the HTTP GET request made is unsuccessful, then the [Failure view](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/nxt-trendz-products-filter-group-lg-failure-view.png) should be displayed
  - When a non-empty value is provided in the Search Input and the **Enter** button is clicked
    - Make an HTTP GET request to the **productsApiUrl** with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and query parameter `title_search` with value as the text provided in the Search Input
    - **_loader_** should be displayed while fetching the data
    - After the data is fetched successfully, display the products list received in the response
  - When a **Category** is clicked
    - Make an HTTP GET request to the URL **productsApiUrl** with `jwt_token` in the Cookies and query parameter `category` with value as the id of the category clicked

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
